PLEASE NOTE: This repository is no longer maintained.

This is a repository to house links and materials as DEIAJ resources for the NWFSC community.


NWFSC's 2023 Program Meetings with the leadership team are centered around DEIAJ discussions. The [guidance document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLlvwCe_eCYcfiEc1d8L2Hc5w7fBCVYkXRFQoD0xoDU/edit) for these meetings highlights the importance of ongoing DEIAJ discussions within the Center community. 

This repo can be used to share internal and external resources to support these discussions.
